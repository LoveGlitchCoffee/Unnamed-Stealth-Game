What makes a good stealth game

no waiting to get through too much - detection stage
can wait, test patience, to do something - anonymous stage
once detected, pretty much fuked, or huge penalty so that player feels wanna restart more stealthly - detection stage
if slip up, SMALL window of opprtunity to make up - suspicion stage
let player choose how to deal with situation - give them different tools to use which effect stealth in different ways

design level like puzzle rather than level - give player a bunch of tools, how they can solve it, don't give shit lot of tools, but many ways to use them

DON'T LIMIT TO CURRENT AI,
